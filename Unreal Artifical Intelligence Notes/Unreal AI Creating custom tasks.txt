Unreal AI: Creating Custom tasks

What do I inherit from?

This is quite a difficult one, it's far more complicated than it's BP counterpart. 
Remember to include "GameplayTasks" in your public dependency modules. 

	UBTTask_BlackboardBase		If you want to have access to blackboard properties.
	
	UBTTask				If you don't need to have access to blackboard properties.



If you were to add this into your BehaviorTree, this would have a name that is not really very useful.
As these are considered nodes, just do this in the constructor of the class and you'll be fine.


NodeName = TEXT("TargetName");

Succeeded Return task

EBTNodeResult::Type UBTTask_Name::ExecuteTask(UBehaviorTreeComponent& OwnerComp), uint8* NodeMemory)
{
	Super::ExecuteTask(OwnerComp, NodeMemory);

	OwnerComp.GetBlackboardComponent()->ClearValue(GetSelectedBlackboardKey());

	return EBTNodeResult::Succeeded;
}
