Unreal AI Notes

Artificial Intelligence is a key component of working with any game, all games have AI of some kind. And how this AI is applied to games
is fundamental in the execution. 


## Keywords ##

NavMesh			Like the Unity Counterpart, unreal engine allows you to place navigation volumes. These navigation volumes allow
			you to dictate what areas AI can move around in.
			It's extremely useful. Please refer to your Unreal Animation projects for an implementation of this!


## Unreal - Creating AI with behaviour states in UE4 ##

Throughout this course we will cover four key areas:

- Behaviour states
- AI sensory perception
- AI awareness
- Searching & Patrolling


These are simple AI branches that are important in the development of your own games, as a lot of modern AAA titles and engines will use systems like
to create and integrate their own AI into their games. 

As a developer I know you really want to create these amazing AAA style experiences. So therefore I think it is imperative that you create solutions 
like this.

## Designing the AI ##

Do not get confused by all of these high level words. 
Artifical Intelligence is simple, it is a trick into thinking that the world is full of real things, when actually they are not. There is thousands 
upon thousands of types of AI. 
You've got friendly AI that come with the player, you've got guard AI that is hostile to the player. You've got advanced AI present in motor racing games.

So let's discuss the first type. From a High level:

Guard AI:

	What is the purpose of this AI?
	What does it add to the game experience?
	Why does it need to be in the game?

Once, obviously these questions are not context exclusive, the answers to this underpin what the AI is going to do and what it's purpose is.

Enemy / Guard AI reacts to stimulous from the player. 
	- Sight, Seeing the player.
	- Hear, Hearing the player.
	- Touch, touching the player.

The amount of Simuli that it gets the more aware it is of the player, and the reactions that comes from the AI determine that level of awarness.
And the following awareness drives it's resulting behaviour, this should be balanced so that it creates a challenge for the player.


## Considering the job of an AI ##

What is the guard AI's job?

If does become suspicious then it should react accordingly. Could provide audio queues? 
If it gathers enough stimulous, then it should react accordingly, move off of it's patrol path and look for the player. 

Finally if it sees the player, and enough sound? (Depending on the needs) then it should become hostile.


## State Machine ##

This sort of stuff is created normally using a finite state machine. You've seen these before when we created a version for Games Programming,
but that was very slapdash, unrefined, callous and badly designed. 
You also had no idea of the underpinning concepts behind making a state machine. 

You've also seen state machines in mathematics, setting up the animator in unity and working with the animation Blueprints inside UE4.


# Awareness System #

The events in a state machine, like in the animator would be driven by an int/float value.
In this case for an awareness system we would use a float or int to drive change in the state machine.

Let's think about this like a number line. It is imperative that you think about things in the most fundamental constructs possible. 
These are complicated systems that if you can learn to think about primatively, will break it down.


- Number line (Scale of stim)

At Level 0 -> There is no awareness, the patrolling AI does not see the player or even consider their presence.



At Level 2 -> Suspicious mode. 



At Level 3 -> Searching mode.



At level 4 -> Hostile, chasing player and Shooting.
