AI & Navigation Systems: Basic Assets


Required Assets

Please remember that all base classes have C++ varients that you can extend the behaviour of through components, and other additional class header files.

-	Character Blueprint (Or ACharacter object) As you remember that ACharacter derieves from APawn. So therefore 
	your AI will need to be able to possess something. Similar to how you possess things.

-	Blackboard -> A blackboard asset is found under the miscallenous tab. This allows you to set blackboard keys of different data types.
	This also comes with a behaviour tree.

	-	You can also base this off of another blackboard through the parent tab.

-	AI Controller. This is what we are using in place of the player controller which posesses a pawn. This one is a computer version of something that posesses a pawn.

	- 	This does come with a blueprint event graph. 
	-	But do not use this event graph. The most efficent way to control your AI is through the balckboard behaviour tree.

-	Behaviour Tree, the paired component of a blackboard.
